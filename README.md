# CDVAE

#### We are assessing a Crystal Diffusion Variational AutoEncoder to generate new materials based on training for a sepcified property

#### My group was focused on training the CDVAE for band gap by creating python scripts to run, test, and capture the training, test, and validation data with Wandb

#### The dataset we worked with was the MP_20 Dataset, which is a dataset that contains 45231 general inorganic materials that differ in structure and composition, as well as only having 1 to 20 number of atoms within each of these materials 

#### Training Results: 

##### Inital Test Number of Atoms Accuracy: 77.09%
##### Final Test Number of Atoms Accuracy: 81.62%

##### Inital Test Types of Atoms Accuracy: 88.82%
##### Final Test Types of Atoms Accuracy: 90.36%
